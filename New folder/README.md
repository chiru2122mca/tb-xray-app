# ü©∫ TB Detection from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses a trained **DenseNet121** model to classify chest X-ray images as **TB (Tuberculosis) Positive** or **Normal**. It also provides **Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations** to explain the model‚Äôs decisions.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Upload chest X-ray images
- Predict TB vs. Normal using a deep learning model
- Visualize regions of attention with **Grad-CAM**
- Download the Grad-CAM result
- Elegant UI with banner, legend, and footer
